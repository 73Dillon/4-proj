 Sprint 4 Project Repository

This project aims to take car sales advertisement data, clean it, complete basic analysis to identify trends, and then create an interactive app that can be used as a tool to simulate random events using the data.

In order to run the app on your machine, you need to have the python package versions listed in requirements.txt installed. In commandline, choose the root project folder as the working directory and enter the below command.

streamlit run app.py

Once complete, the app can be viewed in broswer with URL "http://localhost:10000/" or "http://0.0.0.0:10000"
